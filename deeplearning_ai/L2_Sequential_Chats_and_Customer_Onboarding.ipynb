      "\n",
      "2. **World Cup Madness**: The FIFA World Cup is the most-watched sporting event in the world, boasting around 3.5 billion viewers during each tournament. That's half of the planet tuning in ‚Äî no pressure!\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Longest Soccer Match**: The longest soccer match ever recorded lasted 35 hours and was played in 1981 between two amateur teams in England. Imagine the stamina (and snacks) required for that!\n",

      "4. **Soccer vs. Football**: Did you know that the name \"soccer\" comes from an abbreviation of \"association football\"? It was actually popularized in England to distinguish between different types of football at the time!\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **The Fastest Goal**: The fastest goal in soccer history was scored just 2.8 seconds after the kickoff! Swiss player Hakan ≈û√ºk√ºr netted it in a World Cup match in 2002. Blink and you would‚Äôve missed it!\n",
